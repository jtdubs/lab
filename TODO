General
    Should I sub-divide further into base image + patched image + workstation image ?
        Base
            OS is installed
            Vagrant user (auto-login on Windows)
            VM tools, if needed for IP discovery
        Patched
            Updates applied to base
            VM tools
        Workstation
            Custom software load

CentOs
    Would be nice to have one of these available as well...

Environments
    Kali Vagrant env. prompt for SMB creds for sharing?  Nothing working?

Beyond That
    Windows Server images?
    Domain controller
    Web server
    Domain joined workstations
    etc.
