General
    Should I sub-divide further into base image + patched image + workstation image ?
        Base
            OS is installed
            Vagrant user (auto-login on Windows)
            VM tools, if needed
        Patched
            Updates applied to base
        Workstation
            Custom software load

Kali Base
    Switch to pre-seed:

        https://www.kali.org/dojo/preseed.cfg

Environments
    Stand up some basic test Vagrant envrionments

Beyond That
    Windows Server images?
    Domain controller
    Web server
    Domain joined workstations
    etc.
