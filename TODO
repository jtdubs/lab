- Ubuntu base image
- Need a vagrant user and ssh key on the box (replace packer w/ vagrant??)
- Build script
    Runs the right packer build command
    Registers the resulting box w/ vagrant
    Top-level build script builds all the boxes?

structure:
    boxes/
        arch-base/
            ...
        arch-workstation/
            ...
    envs/
        desktop/
            Vagrantfile
        lab/
            Vagrantfile
