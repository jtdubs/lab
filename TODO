General
    Should I sub-divide further into base image + patched image + workstation image ?
    Base images should ONLY depend on local media, fully reproduceable

Arch Base: yay-git is currently broken because of a go bug??

Kali Base
    Switch to pre-seed:

Envrionments
    Stand up some basic test Vagrant envrionments

Beyond That
    Windows Server images?
    Domain controller
    Web server
    Domain joined workstations
    etc.
