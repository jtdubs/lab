General
    Should I sub-divide further into base image + patched image + workstation image ?
        Base
            OS is installed
            Vagrant user (auto-login on Windows)
            VM tools, if needed
        Patched
            Updates applied to base
        Workstation
            Custom software load

    Update hostnames on derived images... :(

CentOs
    Would be nice to have one of these available as well...

Environments
    Stand up some basic test Vagrant envrionments
    Dev environment is probably ubuntu workstation only
    CTF environment is probably Kali + Win10 Workstation

Beyond That
    Windows Server images?
    Domain controller
    Web server
    Domain joined workstations
    etc.
