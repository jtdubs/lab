General
    Auto-login for linux boxes...

    Should I sub-divide further into base image + patched image + workstation image ?
        Base
            OS is installed
            Vagrant user (auto-login on Windows)
            VM tools, if needed
        Patched
            Updates applied to base
        Workstation
            Custom software load

    Update hostnames on derived images... :(

CentOs
    Would be nice to have one of these available as well...

Environments
    Kali Vagrant env. prompt for SMB creds for sharing?  Nothing working?
    Switch to key-based ssh
    Validate that vagrant winrm & rdp works for windows
    vagrant powershell for remoting into windows would be awesome...

Beyond That
    Windows Server images?
    Domain controller
    Web server
    Domain joined workstations
    etc.
